# My xv6 gallery
xv6-i386 is a perfect target for experimenting small features, like TSC and
IOBM.  My experiments are on different branches, and they could be used for
learning the features.  A small patch of ~300 lines is way better than diving
into the SDM or Linux kernel code.

| branch | description |
| --- | --- |
| rdtsc | TSC mechanism (high-resolution timing) of x86 processors |
| porttest | Port I/O bitmaps |
